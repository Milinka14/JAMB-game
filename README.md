This Python program implements a Jamb dice game simulator, a popular Balkan variant of Yahtzee. The game involves rolling five dice and strategically scoring points by entering results into different categories on a scoresheet. The program features a console-based interface where players can roll dice, choose which dice to re-roll (up to two times), and select scoring categories like "Kenta" (straight), "Full" (full house), "Poker" (four-of-a-kind), or "Jamb" (five-of-a-kind). The scoresheet is structured with three columns ("NA DOLE"/"NA GORE"/"RUÄŒNA") and tracks points for number combinations and special hands.

The code uses custom functions for dice rolling (BacanjeKocke), score tracking via sparse matrix representation (TransformisiMatricu), and input validation to enforce game rules. Players interact through a menu system to manage their turns, with the program automatically calculating scores and preventing invalid moves (e.g., claiming a "Jamb" without five matching dice). The implementation demonstrates handling of game state, user input, and basic randomization while adhering to Jamb's unique scoring rules and turn structure.
